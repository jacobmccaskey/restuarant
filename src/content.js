const aboutUs= `<br><br>Luigi's Italian restuarant was founded after the great war,
Me grandfater founded it for me great grandmother, who always "claimed" she liked italian.
It was later revealed that she said this becuase her first husband was italian, 
and she was a nasty women who liked to cause trouble. Anyways, the restuarant gained
 popularity with the locals, and now we have been in business for 75 years. 
 Me great grandmother is still alive and as full of hate as the day she imigrated from Italy. Please stop by and eat my spagetti.<br><br>`
